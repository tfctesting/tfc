    Computer and the Networked Computer, or data transfer inside the
    data diode #2 between the Networked Computer and the Destination
    Computer. The local testing terminal multiplexer configurations that
    use data diode simulators run two instances of this program.

    when data passes from one program to another. The data diode
    simulator does not provide any of the security properties to the
    endpoint that the hardware data diodes do.

    The visualization is designed to make data transfer between programs
    slower than is the case with actual serial interfaces. This allows
    the user to track the movement of data from one program to another
    with their eyes.
