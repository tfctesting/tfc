        The generated master key depends on a 256-bit salt and the
        password entered by the user. Additional computational strength
        is added by the slow hash function (Argon2d). This method
        automatically tweaks the Argon2 memory parameter so that key
        derivation on used hardware takes at least three seconds. The
        more cores and the faster each core is, the more security a
        given password provides.

        The preimage resistance of BLAKE2b prevents derivation of master
        key from the stored hash, and Argon2d ensures brute force and
        dictionary attacks against the master password are painfully
        slow even with GPUs/ASICs/FPGAs, as long as the password is
        sufficiently strong.

        The salt does not need additional protection as the security it
        provides depends on the salt space in relation to the number of
        attacked targets (i.e. if two or more physically compromised
        systems happen to share the same salt, the attacker can speed up
        the attack against those systems with time-memory-trade-off
        attack).

        A 256-bit salt ensures that even in a group of 4.8*10^29 users,
        the probability that two users share the same salt is just
        10^(-18).*
