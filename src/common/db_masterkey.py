        The generated master key depends on a 256-bit salt and the
        password entered by the user. Additional computational strength
        is added by the slow hash function (Argon2id). The more cores and
        the faster each core is, and the more memory the system has, the
        more secure TFC data is under the same password.

        This method automatically tweaks the Argon2 time and memory cost
        parameters according to best practices as determined in

            https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-irtf-cfrg-argon2-04#section-4

        1) For Argon2 type (y), Argon2id was selected because the
           adversary might be able to run arbitrary code on Destination
           Computer and thus perform a side-channel attack against the
           function.

        2) The maximum number of threads (h) is determined by the number
           available in the system. However, during local testing this
           number is reduced to half to allow simultaneous login to
           Transmitter and Receiver Program.

        3) The maximum amount of memory (m) is what the system has to
           offer. For hard-drive encryption purposes, the recommendation
           is 6GiB. TFC will use that amount (or even more) if available.
           However, on less powerful systems, it will settle for less.

        4) For key derivation time (x), the value is set to at least 3
           seconds, with the maximum being 4 seconds. The minimum value
           is the same as the recommendation for hard-drive encryption.

        5) The salt length is set to 256-bits which is double the
           recommended length. The salt size ensures that even in a
           group of 4.8*10^29 users, the probability that two users
           share the same salt is just 10^(-18).*
            * https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birthday_attack

           The salt does not need additional protection as the security it
           provides depends on the salt space in relation to the number of
           attacked targets (i.e. if two or more physically compromised
           systems happen to share the same salt, the attacker can speed up
           the attack against those systems with time-memory-trade-off
           attack).

        6) The tag length isn't utilized. The result of the key derivation is
           the master encryption key itself, which is set to 32 bytes for
           use in XChaCha20-Poly1305.

        7) Memory wiping feature is not provided.

        To recognize the password is correct, the BLAKE2b hash of the master
        key is stored together with key derivation parameters into the
        login database.
            The preimage resistance of BLAKE2b prevents derivation of master
        key from the stored hash, and Argon2id ensures brute force and
        dictionary attacks against the master password are painfully
        slow even with GPUs/ASICs/FPGAs, as long as the password is
        sufficiently strong.
