    BLAKE2 is the successor of SHA3-finalist BLAKE*, designed by
    Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Samuel Neves, Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn, and
    Christian Winnerlein. The hash function is based on the ChaCha
    stream cipher, designed by djb.

    * BLAKE was designed by Jean-Philippe Aumasson, Luca Henzen,
      Willi Meier, and Raphael C.-W. Phan.

        https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/hashlib.html#blake2

    The reasons for using BLAKE2b in TFC include

        o BLAKE received more in-depth cryptanalysis[1] than Keccak (SHA3):

          "Keccak received a significant amount of cryptanalysis,
           although not quite the depth of analysis applied to BLAKE,
           Grøstl, or Skein."[2]

        o BLAKE shares design elements with SHA-2 that has 11 years of
          cryptanalysis[3] behind it.

        o 128-bit collision/preimage/second-preimage resistance against
          Grover's algorithm running on a quantum Turing machine.

        o The algorithm is bundled in Python3.7's hashlib.

        o Compared to SHA3-256, the algorithm runs faster on CPUs which
          means better hash ratchet performance:

          "The ARX-based algorithms, BLAKE and Skein, perform extremely
           well in software."[2]

        o Compared to SHA3-256, the algorithm runs slower on ASICs which
          means attacks by high-budget adversaries are slower:

          "Keccak has a clear advantage in throughput/area performance
           in hardware implementations."[2]

    Note that while the default length of BLAKE2b (the implementation
    optimized for AMD64 systems) digest is 512 bits, the digest size is
    truncated to 256 bits for the use in TFC.

    The correctness of the BLAKE2b implementation[4] is tested by TFC
    unit tests. The testing is done with the complete suite of BLAKE2b
    known answer tests (KATs).

    Argon2 is a password hashing function designed by Alex Biryukov,
    Daniel Dinu, and Dmitry Khovratovich from the University of
    Luxembourg. The algorithm is the winner of the 2015 Password Hashing
    Competition (PHC).

    For more details, see
        https://password-hashing.net/
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argon2

    The reasons for using Argon2 in TFC include

        o PBKDF2 and bcrypt are not memory-hard, thus they are weak
          against massively parallel computing attacks with
          FPGAs/GPUs/ASICs.[1]

        o scrypt is very complex as it "combines two independent
          cryptographic primitives (the SHA256 hash function, and
          the Salsa20/8 core operation), and four generic operations
          (HMAC, PBKDF2, Block-Mix, and ROMix)."[2] Furthermore,
          scrypt is "vulnerable to trivial time-memory trade-off (TMTO)
          attacks that allows compact implementations with the same
          energy cost."[1]

        o Of all of the PHC finalists, only Catena and Argon2i offer
          cache-timing resistance by using data-independent memory
          access. Catena does not support parallelism[3], thus if it
          later turns out TFC needs protection from cache-timing attacks
          after all, the selection of Argon2 (that always supports
          parallelism) is ideal, as switching from Argon2d to Argon2i is
          trivial.

    The purpose of Argon2 is to stretch a password into a 256-bit key.
    Argon2 features a slow, memory-hard hash function that consumes
    computational resources of an attacker that attempts a dictionary
    or a brute force attack.

    The function also takes a salt (256-bit random value in this case)
    that prevents rainbow-table attacks, and forces each attack to take
    place against an individual (physically compromised) TFC-endpoint,
    or PSK transmission media.

    The used Argon2 version is Argon2d that uses data-dependent memory
    access, which maximizes security against TMTO attacks at the risk of
    side-channel attacks. The IETF recommends using Argon2id (that is
    side-channel resistant and almost as secure as Argon2d against
    TMTO attacks) **except** when there is a reason to prefer Argon2d
    (or Argon2i).
        The reason TFC uses Argon2d is key derivation only takes place
    on Source and Destination Computer. As these computers are connected
    to the Networked Computer only via a data diode, they do not leak
    any information via side-channels to the adversary. The expected
    attacks are against physically compromised data storage devices
    where the encrypted data is at rest. In such a situation, Argon2d is
    the most secure option.

    The correctness of the Argon2d implementation[4] is tested by TFC
    unit tests. The testing is done by comparing the output of the
    argon2_cffi library with the output of the Argon2 reference
    command-line utility under randomized input parameters.

class X448(object):
    """\
    X448 is the Diffie-Hellman function for Curve448-Goldilocks, a
    state-of-the-art elliptical curve published by Mike Hamburg in 2014.

    For more details, see
        https://eprint.iacr.org/2015/625.pdf
        http://ed448goldilocks.sourceforge.net/
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curve448

    The reasons for using X448 in TFC include

        o Curve448 meets the criterion for a SafeCurve[1]:

          Parameters

            - Use of large prime field (p = 2^448 - 2^224 - 1).

            - The Edwards curve (x^2+y^2 = 1-39081x^2y^2) is complete.

            - The base point (x_1,y_1) is on the curve.

          ECDLP security

            - 222.8-bit security against the Pollard's rho method.
                  This is important as the security of hash ratchet
              depends on the security of the root key. Curve25519 is
              thus less feasible choice. Curve448 is also likely to
              resist quantum computers and mathematical breakthroughs
              against ECC for a longer time.

            - Safe against additive and multiplicative transfer.

            - The complex-multiplication field discriminant is 2^447.5,
              which is much larger than the required minimum (2^100).

            - The curve-generation process is fully rigid, i.e. it has
              been completely explained. In comparison, NIST P-curves
              use coefficients generated by hashing unexplained seeds.

          ECC security

            - Use of Montgomery ladder that protects from side channel
              attacks by doing constant-time single-scalar multiplication.

            - 221.8-bit security against twist attacks (small-subgroup
              attack combined with invalid-curve attack).

            - Support for complete single-scalar and multi-scalar
              multiplication formulas.

            - Points on Curve448 (e.g. public keys) are
              indistinguishable from uniform random strings.

        o Safer curves (M-511 and E-521) don't have robust implementations.

        o NIST has announced X448 will be included in the SP 800-186.[2]

        o Its public keys do not require validation as long as the
          resulting shared secret is not zero:

          "[X448] is actually two curves, where any patterns of bits
           will be interpreted as a point on one of the curves or on the
           other."[3]

        o Its public keys are reasonably short (84 chars when WIF-encoded)
          to be manually typed from Networked Computer to Source Computer.

    The correctness of the X448 implementation[4] is tested by TFC unit
    tests. The testing is done in limited scope by using the official
    test vectors.

        """Generate the X448 private key.

        The pyca/cryptography's key generation process is as follows:

        1. When `X448PrivateKey.generate()` is called by this method,
           the `generate()` class method imports the OpenSSL backend[1].

        2. Importing the backend causes Python to execute this[2] line
           of code that runs the `__init__()` method[3] of the Backend
           class, which then calls the `activate_osrandom_engine()`
           instance method[4].

        3. Calling the `activate_osrandom_engine()` disables the default
           OpenSSL CSPRNG, and activates the "OS random engine".[5]

        4. Unlike OpenSSL user-space CSPRNG that only seeds from
           /dev/urandom, the OS random engine uses GETRANDOM(0) syscall
           that sources all of its entropy directly from /dev/urandom.
           The OS random engine does not suffer from the fork() weakness
           where forked process is not automatically reseeded, and it's
           also safe from issues with OpenSSL CSPRNG initialization.[6]

        5. The fallback option (/dev/urandom) of OS random engine might
           be problematic on pre-3.17 kernels if the CSPRNG has not been
           properly seeded. However, TFC checks that the kernel version
           of the OS it's running on is at least 4.8. This means that
           the used source of entropy is always GETRANDOM(0).[7] This
           can be verified from the source code as well: The last
           parameter `0` of the GETRANDOM syscall[8] indicates
           GRND_NONBLOCK flag is not set. This means /dev/urandom is
           used, and that it does not yield entropy until it has been
           properly seeded. This is the same case as with TFC's
           `csprng()` function.

    ChaCha20 is a stream cipher published by Daniel J. Bernstein (djb)
    in 2008. The algorithm is an improved version of Salsa20 -- another
    stream cipher by djb -- selected by ECRYPT into the eSTREAM
    portfolio in 2008. The improvement in question is, ChaCha20
    increases the per-round diffusion compared to Salsa20 while
    maintaining or increasing speed.

    For more details, see
        https://cr.yp.to/chacha.html
        https://cr.yp.to/snuffle.html
        https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salsa20#ChaCha_variant

    The Poly1305 is a Wegman-Carter Message Authentication Code also
    designed by djb. The MAC is provably secure if ChaCha20 is secure.
    The 128-bit tag space ensures the attacker's advantage to create an
    existential forgery is negligible.

    For more details, see
        https://cr.yp.to/mac.html

    The version used in TFC is the XChaCha20-Poly1305-IETF[1], a variant
    of the ChaCha20-Poly1305-IETF (RFC 8439[2]). Quoting libsodium, the
    XChaCha20 (=eXtended-nonce ChaCha20) variant allows encryption of
    ~2^64 bytes per message, encryption of practically unlimited number
    of messages, and safe use of random nonces due to the 192-bit nonce
    space[3].

    The reasons for using XChaCha20-Poly1305 in TFC include

        o The Salsa20 algorithm has 14 years of cryptanalysis behind it.[4]

        o The increased diffusion over the well-received Salsa20.[5]

        o The algorithm is much faster compared to AES (in cases where
          the CPU and/or implementation does not support AES-NI).[5]

        o Security against cache-timing attacks on all CPUs (unlike AES
          on CPUs without AES-NI).[6]

        o The good name of djb.[7]

    The correctness of the XChaCha20-Poly1305 implementation[8] is
    tested by TFC unit tests. The testing is done in limited scope by
    using the libsodium and official IETF test vectors.

    TFC adds padding to messages it outputs. The padding ensures each

    When traffic masking is enabled, the padding contributes to traffic

    """Generate a cryptographically secure random key.

    The default key length is 32 bytes (256 bits).

    The key is generated by the Linux kernel's cryptographically secure
    pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG).

    Since Python 3.6.0, `os.urandom` is a wrapper for best available
    CSPRNG. The 3.17 and earlier versions of Linux kernel do not support
    the GETRANDOM call, and Python 3.7's `os.urandom` will in those
    cases fall back to non-blocking `/dev/urandom` that is not secure on
    live distros as they have low entropy at the start of the session.

    TFC uses `os.getrandom(n, flags=0)` explicitly. This forces use of
    recent enough Python interpreter (3.6.0 or later) and limits Linux
    kernel version to 3.17 or later.* The flag 0 will block urandom if
    the internal state of the CSPRNG has less than 128 bits of entropy.
    See PEP 524 for more details:
        https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0524/

    * The `/dev/urandom` was redesigned around ChaCha20 in the version
      4.8 of Linux kernel (https://lwn.net/Articles/686033/), so as a
      good practice TFC runs the `check_kernel_version` to ensure only
      the new design of the CSPRNG is used.

    Quoting PEP 524:
        "The os.getrandom() is a thin wrapper on the getrandom()
         syscall/C function and so inherit of its behaviour. For
         example, on Linux, it can return less bytes than
         requested if the syscall is interrupted by a signal."

    However, quoting (https://lwn.net/Articles/606141/) on GETRANDOM:
        "--reads of 256 bytes or less from /dev/urandom are guaranteed to
         return the full request once that device has been initialized."

    Since the largest key generated in TFC is the 56-byte X448 private
    key, GETRANDOM is guaranteed to always work. As a good practice
    however, TFC checks that the length of the obtained entropy is
    correct.

    The output of GETRANDOM is further compressed with BLAKE2b. The
    preimage resistance of the hash function protects the internal
    state of the entropy pool just in case some user decides to modify
    the source to accept pre-4.8 Linux Kernel that has no backtracking
    protection. Another reason for the hashing is its recommended by djb:
        https://media.ccc.de/v/32c3-7210-pqchacks#video&t=1116

    Since BLAKE2b only produces 1..64 byte digests, its use limits the
    size of the key to 64 bytes. This is not a problem for TFC because
    again, the largest key it generates is the 56-byte X448 private key.
